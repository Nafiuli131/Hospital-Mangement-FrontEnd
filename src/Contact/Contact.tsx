            <p>Hi I'm Nafiul Islam</p>
            <p>
              I pursued my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from the
              passion of exploring this field. With this aim, I have the focus
              to engage in core software development, and contribute to
              academic-industrial research that would make the lives of common
              people better. I am more fond of learning and working in the
              domains of Blockchain, Algorithms, Web Developing, Machine
              Learning, Data Mining and Networking related developments. Also, I
              have a keen interest in applying software engineering. I wish to
              contribute to the countryâ€™s economy with my skills and build
              applications that can positively affect human lives in society.
            </p>
